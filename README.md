### Challenge Description
”Hey guys, Jonnen98cool back again with another hash cracking challenge O_O !! This time I got something special: The IMPOSSIBLE hash (not technically but you get the idea)! This bad boy is made with the nasty bcrypt algorithm (fr scary :O), and I’ll even give you a hint: The original message is over 50 characters long, no cap! Good luck cracking this one, you’re gonna need it. As always, remember to like, comment and subscribe! See you next week for another AWESOME hash, Skibidi”
